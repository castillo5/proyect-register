The initial purpose of this page is for each table to have its own button, thus making the CV more efficient and generating a better order.


First, when starting my code, in theory, it is 

npm i express 

and also 
npm init -y 

to install the node modules, in turn, the database that is in the init-database file must be created and ensure that each table is ready to avoid conflicts. 
After that, start the server with 

npm run dev. 

If everything started correctly, it should be on host: 3000. Seeing various ways to fill the tables, each one having its own cvs.

The technologies used were Vite, Express, Corn, and Node itself.
When it came to standardizing, I figured out which entities were clients and billing, and then, from those main entities, I broke down the others.
